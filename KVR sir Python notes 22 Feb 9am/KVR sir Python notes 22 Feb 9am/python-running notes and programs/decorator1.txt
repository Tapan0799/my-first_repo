Decorators in Python:

what are decorators in python

Decorator is a function that can take another function as an argument and extend its functionality
and return the modified function with extended functionality



def divisionofNumbers(number1, number2):
      result = number1/number2
      return result

result = divisionofNumbers(4,2)
print(result)

result1 = divisionofNumbers(4,0)
print(result)

Decorators are used to add or modify the existing functionality without changing the original function

This is an example of extensibility
extensibility: without modifying the existing code, we can add new functionality

we can also add multiple decorators also to single function
this is called decorator chaining

add new functionalities like addition, multiplication to the existing function we can use decorator chaining
