3 weeks session
Focussing on python interview questions and indepth concepts, problems that
will be asked in interviews

1. Is python interpreted or compiled language?
python is interpreter language

2. What is difference between interpreter and compiler?

complier : scans the entire program and converts to machine code as whole
Interpreter: This read line by line of byte code and translates one statement at a time

Compiler: It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the 
overall execution time is faster

Interpreter: It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the 
overall execution time is slower

compiler: Generates intermediate object code which further requires linking and also
this needs more memory

Interpreter : no intermediate code is generated

Just In time compiler is available in the python when we download
http://pypy.org/download.html -- original flavour of python

CPython -- python implemented in c langauge
Python program is converted into byte code using c functions

Jython - Jython first compile python into java byte code. This byte code can be excuted
by JVM(Java Virtual Machine)

we will start seeing
