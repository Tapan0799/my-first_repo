Exceptions in Python

In python there are 2 types of errors:
syntax errors
Runtime exceptions

syntax error

a=5
if a %2 == 0
   print("even")

#syntax error

Runtime exceptions are also called Runtime Errors
during the execution of the program if something goes wrong because of some programming logic
or some data issues, then the program gives some errors
These are called Runtime exceptions or Runtime Errors

a = 2
b = 0
c = a/b

There are different types of errors or exceptions
ZeroDivisionError
TypeError
FileNotFoundError

We need to handle the exceptions so that the other part of any important code gets executed properly

handling the execption
using try-except (block)

try - the block where exception is generated, in try block if exception comes it will go to except block
otherwise control will not go to except block
except - the block where exception is handled
finally - this is the last block that gets executed always if exception comes or does not come

use of finally -- generally if the python program is connecting to databases or file systems
finally will be used to close the database connections or file resource connections
