1. list the employees whose salary is greater than average salary of all the employees

sub queries

a query inside another query is subquery
this subquery can return single rows or multiple rows


   select * from employee where emp_salary >( select avg(emp_salary) from employee )


   select * from employee where emp_salary > 22500


2. list the max salary in the employee table

select max(emp_salary) from employee;

3. *** important interview question

   find the 2nd highest salary from the employee table


   select * from employee where emp_salary = (select max(A.emp_salary) 
from (select emp_name, emp_id, emp_salary from employee where emp_salary 
< (select max(emp_salary) from employee) ) A)



write small sql query -- result -- assume this as one logical table
write one more query to select the data from the above table

how can we find nth highest salary

select count(1) from employee where emp_salary > 15000

  
   select emp_salary from employee A where 2 = (select count(1) from employee B where B.emp_salary>A.emp_salary)

nth highest salary
  select emp_salary from employee A where 3 = (select count(1) from employee B where B.emp_salary>=A.emp_salary)


select emp_salary,count(*) from employee A, employee B where B.emp_salary>A.emp_salary



join operations

joining multiple tables based on column values

inner join

select A.emp_id, B.dept_id from Employee A Inner join Department B on A.dept_id=B.dept_id
